# README

Welcome to the Packet Tracer project covering ACL, CLI, SNMP, FTP, SSH & TELNET, SMTP & POP3, HTTPS, OSPF & RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF!

## Description

This Packet Tracer project is designed to provide hands-on experience and understanding of various networking concepts, protocols, and technologies. It covers Access Control Lists (ACL), Command Line Interface (CLI), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell (SSH) & Telnet, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) & Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3), Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) & Routing Information Protocol (RIP), and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Cisco website [here](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).

Once Packet Tracer is installed:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Packet Tracer.
3. Import the `.pkt` files included in the project.
4. Explore the different network scenarios and configurations provided in the project.

## Usage

This Packet Tracer project offers a wide range of functionalities:

- **ACL**: Explore and configure Access Control Lists to control traffic flow in the network.
- **CLI**: Practice using Command Line Interface to configure network devices.
- **SNMP**: Implement Simple Network Management Protocol for network monitoring and management.
- **FTP**: Set up File Transfer Protocol for transferring files between network devices.
- **SSH & Telnet**: Configure Secure Shell and Telnet for remote access to network devices.
- **SMTP & POP3**: Configure Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and Post Office Protocol 3 for email communication.
- **HTTPS**: Implement Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure for secure web communication.
- **OSPF & RIP**: Configure and compare Open Shortest Path First and Routing Information Protocol for dynamic routing.
- **EIGRP**: Configure Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol for efficient routing within the network.
